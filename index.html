	<h3>Something Cool About Me</h3>
	<p>Hello! My name is Emmanuel Cereceres and I am 17 years old. My birthday is on April 26 and i was born in 2003. I am a senor in high school and I attend Patino School of Entrepreneurship. I enjoy playing video games. As of right now I am actually stuck on two games, one being on console and one on PC. I really enjoy playing Forza on my Xbox and I enjoy playing Valorant on my computer. Forza is a racing game and Valorant is more of a first person shooter. I really enjoy music as well, I listen to all kinds of music mainly because my dad does. I could be listening to new school rap or old school rap, maybe some mexican music, I even know a couple country songs. You can't forget about rock music, I listen to a little bit of that as well. I usually listen to rap though, that is my favorite. My favorite song as of now would possibly have to be Rollbounce by PanchoGm ft MemoTheMafioso.</p>
	<p>I currently live in Fresno, California in the old fig garden area with both my parents and younger brother. I have two dogs one being an American Bulldog and the other a Poodle. I don't really have a lot of family living in Fresno, most of my family is located down in Mexico and Texas. I have never been outside of my home state California but I would really love to travel throughout my adult years. One of my top places I want to visit is Canada.</p>
